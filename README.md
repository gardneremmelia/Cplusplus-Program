# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what it was solving
In the first couple weeks of my Programming Languages course, I created an application that applied program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code. One of the clocks displays 12 hour format, while the other displays 24 hour format. Users may add hours, minutes, and seconds to the clock by selecting an option from the given menu. 

# What did you do particularly well?
During this assignment, I struggled a bit with a few functions and the clocks didn't function correctly because I didn't understand that I was changing variables in methods that should've just been returning them. Upon submitting the project, my instructor gave me detailed feedback on what I could fix to make my program work correctly. After understanding what I did wrong, I was able to fix the program so that it works correctly. In the inital submission, I believe that my main method was done particularly well, displaying the neatly formatted clocks and menu, and making changes to the clocks after prompting the user for input. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I still struggle with my comments and whitespace, so I could definitely learn more about how to improve my code in those aspects, specifically for the C++ programming language. This would make my programs more organized and readable. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this code was the pad method. I struggled with figuring out how to initialize variables to format the string so that I could pad values less than 10 with a leading zero, as a clock does (example: 03 rather than 3). This took a lot of problem-solving, and feedback from my instructor. I had the right idea in my inital program, but I needed to make slight changes after realizing what I did wrong and revisiting the program after learning more about C++ programming language.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Learning how to properly modularize my code and create functions is a skill that is transferable to other projects. This skill will help me keep future projects organized so that the main function has the least amount of code and calls upon other functions to stay neat and efficient. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by (as mentioned above) learning how to properly modularize my code and create functions to keep the main function as short as possible and keep the program structured. I used inline comments to describe what certain parts of the code does, and I commented my methods to make the code more readable. I also used whitespace to separate different blocks of code to keep it organized. Using functions keeps the program maintainable because it separates responsibilities for a specific tasks which makes the main function easier to work with and read.
